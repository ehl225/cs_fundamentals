Short Answer:
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
  A. To communicate to others what they want the code to do without using a specific language syntax.
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
  A. Although the pseudocode is written correctly for humans, it would not work on the computer because it is not written in a specific language's syntax.

Programming Assignment:
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
FUNCTION chooseNumber(first number, second number)
  IF first number is greater than second number
    PRINT first number
  ELSE second number is greater than first number
    PRINT second number
  ELSE
    PRINT "Error: Both numbers are equal"
  END IF
END FUNCTION
2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
FUNCTION printNumbers
  INIT numbers
  FOR each number from 1 to 100
    PRINT number
  END for
END FUNCTION
3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
FUNCTION phonebookSearch(entry)
  FOR each item in phonebook
    IF entry equals item
      RETURN item
    END IF
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
var phonebook=['a','b','c','d','e'];
function phonebookSearch(entry) {
  for (var i=0; i<phonebook.length; i++) {
    if( entry==phonebook[i]){
      return (phonebook[i] + " was located in the phonebook");
    }
  }
}
phonebookSearch('b');
